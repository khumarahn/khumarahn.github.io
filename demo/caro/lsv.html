        <h3>Intermittent map</h3>
        <div>
            Consider the standard Liverani-Saussol-Vaienti map \(T \colon [0,1] \to [0,1]\) with parameter \(\alpha &gt; 0\):
            \[
                T \colon x \mapsto
                \begin{cases}
                    x (1 + 2^{1 / \alpha} x^{1 / \alpha}), &amp; x &lt; 0.5 \\
                    2 (x - 1), &amp; x &gt; 0.5
                \end{cases}
            \]

        <h3>Iterates of the transfer operator</h3>
        Let \(L\) be the transfer operator with respect to the Lebesgue measure:
        \[
            (L v)(x) = \sum_{y \in T^{-1} x} \frac{v(y)}{T'(y)}
        \]
        We are interested in the iterates \(L^n v\) for functions \(v\) with \(\|v - 1\|_{C^1}\) small.
        Choose such a \(v\) and using the above formula compute \(L^n v\):
        <div id='Ln'></div>
        <div style="width:75%;margin:auto;margin-bottom:1em">
            \(v(x)\): <input type="text" id="v" style="width:75%" value="1 + 0.05 * Math.sin(6*Math.PI*x)" />
            <input type="button" onclick="alphaChange();" value="Set" />
        </div>
        <div>
            Such a computation is utmost inefficient: we cannot compute much more than 10 iterates.
            But it gives an idea.
        </div>
        <div>
            We would like to prove that \(L^n v\) is monotone on \([1/2,1]\) in the sense that
            \[
                (L^{n+1}v)(x) \leq (L^n v)(x)
                \quad \text{for all } n \geq 0 \text{ and } x \in [1/2,1]
            \]
            But how?
        </div>


        <h3>Density and derivatives</h3>
        <div>
            Here we plot an approximation of the invariant density \(h\) normalized so that \(\int_{1/2}^1 h(x) \, dx = 1\).
            The invariant density is hard to approximate naively, so we use a precise (and very delicate!) algorithm

            Our <a href="https://github.com/khumarahn/khumarahn.github.io/tree/main/demo/caro">implementation</a>
            is not using rigorous numerics, but the expected accuracy is roughly 15 decimal digits.
            (This is the expected accuracy on \([1/2,1]\); near zero the accuracy is worse.)
        </div>
        <div id='hn'></div>

        <h3>Three conditions</h3>
        <div> Let \(h\) denote the density of the invariant measure and let \(w = 1 / T'\).
            For \( x \in [0,1] \) let \( y_1 &lt; y_2 \) denote the two preimages of \(x\) under \(T\).
            Suppose that for each \(x\):
            \[
                \Bigl[ \frac{h'}{h} w + w' \Bigr](y_1)
                \leq \Bigl[ \frac{h'}{h} w + w' \Bigr](y_2)
                \tag{C1}
            \]
            and
            \[
                \Bigl[ \frac{h''}{h} w^2 + 3 \frac{h'}{h} w' w + w'' w + (w')^2 \Bigr](y_1)
                \geq \Bigl[ \frac{h''}{h} w^2 + 3 \frac{h'}{h} w' w + w'' w + (w')^2 \Bigr](y_2)
                .
                \tag{C2}
            \]
            Suppose also that for all \(x\) on the second branch,
            \[
                x \geq \frac{y_1}{1 + \frac{h(y_2) w(y_2)}{h(y_1) w(y_1)}}
                + \frac{y_2}{1 + \frac{h(y_1) w(y_1)}{h(y_2) w(y_2)}}
                .
                \tag{C3}
            \]
        </div>
        <div>
            If the three conditions above are satisfied, then there is an argument (which has to be checked!) that
            the cone of positive functions
            \[
                \Bigl\{
                v : \frac{v'}{v} \geq \frac{h'}{h}
                \quad \text{and} \quad
                \frac{v''}{v} \leq \frac{h''}{h}
                \Bigr\}
            \]
            is invariant under iterations of \(L\), and that \( (L v)(x) \leq v(x) \)
            for all such \(v\) and \(x \in [1/2,1]\).
        </div>
        <div>
            It is not clear however how to verify these conditions. But we can compute an approximation for \(h\) and plot some graphs.
            Below C1, C2 and C3 are the differences of the two sides in corresponding conditions, taken so that positive values
            mean that the condition holds.

        <h3>Appendix 1: Asymptotics of \(h'\) and \(h''\) near zero</h3>
        <div>
            These are the normalized plots of \(h' / h\) and \(h'' / h\),
            which near \(x = 0\) should behave like \(1/x\) and \(1/x^2\) respectively:

        <h3>Appendix 2: Induced transfer operator</h3>
        <div>
            The induced transfer operator on \([1/2, 1]\) is approximated by a <span id='R_cols'></span>
            matrix acting on the basis of Chebyshev polynomials.
            (The first coefficient is doubled because we work in terms of the coefficients \((c_k)\)
            as in Section 5.8 of the 3rd edition of <a href="https://numerical.recipes">Numerical Recipes</a>.)
        </div>
        <div id='R_matrix'></div>
        <div>
            The leading eigenvalues are <span id='R_evalues'></span>
        </div>
        <div>
            The leading eigenvector is
        </div>
        <div id='R_evector'></div>

        <h3>Appendix 3: Sanity check</h3>
        <div>
            There are two basic ways to check sanity of the calculation of \(h\):
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The leading eigenvalue of \(R\) should be equal to 1. We got \(1 + \varepsilon\) where
                    <span id='lambda_error'></span>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    \(\frac{h(1/2)}{h(1)}\) should be equal to \(\frac{2 + \alpha^{-1}}{2}\). Our error here is
                    <span id='h12_error'></span>.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>Appendix 4: Simplified conditions (C1)-(C3)</h3>
        <div> The three conditions above can be written in a different way,
            which seems simpler to verify numerically. Here we use that the second branch is exactly
            \(2x - 1\). As before, let \(h\) denote the density of the invariant measure and let
            \(w = 1 / T'\). For \( x \in [0,1] \) let \( y_1 &lt; y_2 \) denote the two preimages of
            \(x\) under \(T\). Then (C1) is equivalent to:
            \[
                \frac{h'(x)}{h(x)}
                \leq \frac{1}{2} \frac{h'(y_2)}{h(y_2)}
                \tag{C'1}
                ,
            \]
            (C2) is equivalent to
            \[
                \frac{h''(x)}{h(x)}
                \geq \frac{1}{4} \frac{h''(y_2)}{h(y_2)}
                \tag{C'2}
                ,
            \]
            and (C3) is equivalent to
            \[
                (x - y_1) h(x) \geq \frac{1}{2}(y_2 - y_1) h(y_2)
                \tag{C'3}
                .
            \]
